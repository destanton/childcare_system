# Kid Kare
A homework assignment from week 8 at The Iron Yard

This project utitlizes Django, Python & Semantic UI.

### About the Application
This application was designed with parents in mind. Parents are often rushing to get their kids checked into daycare. To help ease the burden on the parent, I've allowed a parent to check a child in and out via a 4 digit code. The parent has the option of creating and viewing a profile page where they can see check-in/check-out times and a total bill due for their enrolled children.
The staff has the ability to create new children in the database and then a random 4 digit number is automatically assigned to the child. The parent can opt to have this code changed by the staff, if they prefer a specific set of digits. All codes must be unique - this limitation is set on the database side. The staff has a profile view that shows all children and their status (checked-in/checked-out). 

#### Future Plans
I would like to expand the children model to have specific notes and pictures attached to each child.
